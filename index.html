            <p>Whether you area food based business or restaurant, I would love to work with you! I primarily work with
                natural light, learning to paint the light to make your images jump off the screen. Telling a story with
                each and every image or video to make your audience hungry!

                Photographing location, food and drink items for your menu or social media. Packages can be customized
                from monthly menu item shoots for social media, to one time full menu/location shoot packages. I like to
                work with you to determine your goals and target market before presenting a creative shot list for your
                shoot.

        <p>
            Eating whole foods is simple: think fresh, unprocessed ingredients. It’s a natural fit for people who want
            to eat plant based, vegetarian, and vegan diets — and we’re down with that. Plus, these recipes are so, so
            good.

                    <h3>Berry and coconut cream cake</h3>
                    <p>
                        There’s nothing like sweet, fresh berries in summer. This vegan cake is studded with jewel-like
                        fruit.

                        Yes, that topping’s coconut cream, lightened with coconut yogurt. The cocoa cake is naturally
                        sweetened with dates.

                    <h3>Burgers with avocado</h3>
                    <p>
                        Homemade veggie burgers are way healthier than packaged ones. These rely on sweet, ripe
                        plantain,
                        black beans, and a kick of chipotle powder. And sliced avocado makes everything better.

                    <h3>Chilled asparagus soup</h3>
                    <p>
                        Minimal cooking, some blender time, and easy to transport — this creamy vegan soup is a winner.
                        Asparagus is an excellent source of vitamin K. And our friend avocado makes it creamy without
                        dairy.
